# Design goals

Ergo brings logic programming to the .NET world with an opinionated Prolog implementation that targets the CLR.
Its main design goal is that of extending the C# language through a declarative API that makes inference easier to work with, while being efficient enough to be used in high-demand applications such as games.
This focus on inter-operability means that Ergo has a minimal feature set, but is easy to extend and tailor to each use case.
